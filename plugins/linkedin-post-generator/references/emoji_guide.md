# Emoji Guide for LinkedIn Posts

## When to Use Emojis

Emojis work on LinkedIn when they serve a structural or tonal purpose. They should enhance readability, not decorate.

## Effective Uses

### Section Markers

Use a single emoji at the start of a section or key line to create visual anchors:

```
The 3 things that changed my career:

-> Hard conversations build trust faster than avoiding them
-> Writing clarifies thinking better than talking
-> Saying no is a leadership skill
```

Replace `->` with a consistent emoji per post. Good choices: a pointing hand, a check mark, a small diamond, or an arrow.

### Bullet Replacements

Replace plain dashes or bullets with a single emoji type for visual rhythm:

```
What I look for when hiring:
* Curiosity over credentials
* Communication over code speed
* Ownership over task completion
```

One emoji type per list. Mixing types looks chaotic.

### Tone Setting

A single emoji in the hook can set the emotional register:

- A thinking face before a question
- A warning sign before a contrarian take
- A raised hand before a confession

One per hook, maximum.

### Key Takeaway Marker

Use an emoji to call out the single most important line:

```
The takeaway: your career is a marathon, not a sprint.
```

A pointing hand, a star, or a key work well here.

## Dos

- **One emoji type per structural role** — consistency over variety
- **Place at line start** — emojis work as visual anchors, not inline decoration
- **Max 5-8 emojis per post** — enough to add structure, not enough to overwhelm
- **Match the tone** — professional posts get subtle emojis (arrows, checks), casual posts can use warmer ones (hands, faces)
- **Use Unicode emojis** — they render consistently across platforms

## Don'ts

- **Don't stack emojis** — never use two or more in a row
- **Don't end lines with emojis** — it reads as decoration, not structure
- **Don't use emojis in every paragraph** — whitespace is already a visual separator
- **Don't use obscure emojis** — stick to universally understood symbols
- **Don't use emojis as a substitute for writing** — if the post needs emojis to be interesting, the writing needs work
- **Don't use the laughing-crying face** — it reads as unprofessional on LinkedIn regardless of context

## Emoji Selection by Post Type

| Post Type | Good Choices | Avoid |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Story | Pointing hand, arrow, star | Party poppers, celebration |
| Insight | Light bulb, key, target | Fire, rocket |
| How-To | Numbered list (1-7), check mark, arrow | Random objects |
| Question | Thinking face (hook only), pointing hand | Question marks (redundant) |
| Listicle | Consistent bullets (diamond, dot, arrow) | Mixed emoji types |

## The Test

Before publishing, read the post without emojis. If it reads just as well, the emojis are decoration — remove them. If the emojis genuinely improve scannability or tone, keep them.
