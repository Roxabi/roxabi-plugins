# LinkedIn Post Best Practices

## Optimal Post Length

- **Sweet spot:** 1300-2000 characters (roughly 200-300 words)
- Posts under 1000 characters feel thin and get less engagement
- Posts over 3000 characters lose readers before the fold
- The "See more" cutoff is approximately 210 characters — your hook must land before this

## Hook Techniques

The first 1-2 lines determine whether anyone reads the rest. Use one of these patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Bold claim** | "Most LinkedIn advice is wrong." |
| **Pattern interrupt** | "I got fired. Best thing that ever happened." |
| **Question** | "What's the one skill no one taught you at work?" |
| **Story opener** | "3 years ago I made a decision that changed everything." |
| **Counter-intuitive** | "The best leaders don't motivate their teams." |
| **Number hook** | "5 things I learned after 10 years in tech:" |
| **Confession** | "I used to think networking was fake. I was wrong." |

Avoid: generic greetings, "I'm excited to announce", throat-clearing preambles.

## Formatting

- **Short paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences maximum per paragraph
- **Line breaks:** Add a blank line between every paragraph — wall-of-text kills engagement
- **Bullet points:** Use for lists of 3+ items — easier to scan than prose
- **Numbered lists:** Use when order matters (steps, rankings, timelines)
- **Bold text:** Sparingly, for key phrases only — not whole sentences
- **ALL CAPS:** Never for entire words — it reads as shouting

## Content Types

### Story
Personal experience with a lesson. Structure: situation, conflict, resolution, takeaway. Most engaging format on LinkedIn.

### Insight
A non-obvious observation about your industry. Best when it challenges conventional wisdom or connects two unexpected ideas.

### Question
Opens a discussion. Ask something specific and opinionated, not generic. "What's your unpopular opinion about remote work?" beats "What do you think about remote work?"

### How-To
Actionable steps someone can use today. Number the steps. Keep each step to 1-2 sentences. Provide the "what" and "why", not just the "how".

### Listicle
3-7 items with brief explanations. Odd numbers (3, 5, 7) tend to perform better. Each item should be scannable on its own.

## Hashtag Strategy

- **Count:** 3-5 hashtags per post (more looks spammy, fewer limits reach)
- **Placement:** At the very end of the post, after a line break
- **Mix:** 1-2 broad hashtags (large audience) + 2-3 niche hashtags (targeted reach)
- **Relevance:** Every hashtag must relate to the post content — never use trending-but-unrelated tags
- **Case:** Use CamelCase for readability (#SoftwareEngineering not #softwareengineering)

## Engagement Tactics

- **End with a question:** Invites comments. Make it specific and easy to answer
- **Tag sparingly:** Only tag people directly relevant to the content — mass-tagging annoys
- **Respond to comments:** Reply within the first hour to boost the algorithm
- **Post timing:** Weekday mornings (7-9 AM) and lunch hours (11:30 AM-1 PM) in your target timezone
- **Consistency:** 2-4 posts per week builds momentum without burning out

## Call-to-Action Patterns

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Opinion ask** | "Do you agree? I'd love to hear your take." |
| **Experience ask** | "Have you been through something similar?" |
| **Share ask** | "If this resonates, share it with someone who needs to hear it." |
| **Action ask** | "Try this for one week and let me know what happens." |
| **Follow ask** | "Follow me for more on [topic]." |

Use one CTA per post. Two or more dilutes the ask.

## Things to Avoid

- Self-promotion without value — lead with the insight, not the pitch
- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!") — transparent and penalized by the algorithm
- Negativity about competitors or colleagues — LinkedIn rewards constructive takes
- Walls of text without line breaks — format for mobile first
- Posting and ghosting — if you don't engage with comments, the algorithm suppresses your reach
