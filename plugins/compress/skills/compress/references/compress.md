# Compress Mode

Mode body for `/compress` default mode — loaded by SKILL.md Phase 3. Contains the symbols legend, the transform rules, mode-specific edge cases, the Phase 5 ledger-append template, and the measured rationale that governs when a substitution is worth making. Output fidelity is governed by SKILL.md `## Guardrails` (G1–G4).

## Symbols

`∀` all | `∃`/`∄` exists | `∈`/`∉` member | `∧`/`∨` and/or | `¬` not | `→` then | `⟺` iff | `∅` empty | `∩`/`∪` intersect/union | `⊂` subset | `∥` parallel | `|X|` count | `:=`/`←` assign | `{ }` scoped block | `;` sequence | `()` params | `↦` maps to

## Analyze Targets (Phase 2)

Identify: repeated nouns (≥3×) | verbose conditionals | iteration prose | magic numbers | redundant examples | filler.

## Transform Rules (R1–R10)

- **R1** Definitions (disambiguation, ¬economy — pays only past the SKILL.md break-even inequality): concept ≥ 3× → Greek var in `Let:` block (after title). Lowercase, mnemonic, collision-checked per SKILL.md Phase 3. Template:
  ```
  Let:
    η := set of all findings
    κ(f) ∈ [0,100] ∩ ℤ  — confidence
    θ := 80               — threshold
  ```
- **R2** Predicates: multi-bullet conditions → `pred(x) ⟺ A ∧ B ∧ C`
- **R3** Quantifiers: "for each" → `∀ x ∈ Y:` | "if any" → `∃ x:` | "exists" → `X ∃ →`
- **R4** Implications: "if X then Y" → `X → Y`
- **R5** Terse imperative: multi-sentence → single line + symbols
- **R6** Tables + lists: keep structure, compress text, ¬drop items
- **R7** Prune examples: keep only when notation ambiguous
- **R8** Constants: literal ≥ 2× → named constant
- **R9** Process encapsulation: procedure/workflow → `O_name { step₁; step₂; … } → output`
- **R10** Parameterized patterns: repeated pattern(varying inputs) → `F(x, y)`

**¬compress:** superseded by SKILL.md `## Guardrails` G1–G4 — commands, file paths, tool names, spawn templates, safety rules sit under the G4 verbatim floor; frontmatter, code blocks, `$ARGUMENTS`, table structure stay protected by SKILL.md Safety + R6.

## Mode Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Marker present + src-sha fresh | "already compressed at L<x>", tweaks only (replaces the v1 "already formal" heuristic) |
| Marker absent on a formal-looking file | Treat as uncompressed source — compress normally |
| No repeated concepts | Skip R1, apply R2–R10 |
| Mixed prose + code | Prose only |

## What Actually Saves Tokens (measured)

Per-glyph cost is tokenizer-dependent — glyph substitution alone is not compression:

- `∀ x ∈ Y:` and `for each x in Y:` both encode to 6 tokens — identical.
- A fully symbolic `Let:` block measured 52–53 tokens vs 49–51 for its structured-English equivalent — token-equal-or-worse despite far fewer characters.
- Greek renames (R1) cost ≈1 token per occurrence; they pay off only when the renamed concept is long and used often.
- The bulk of real token gains comes from R5/R6/R7 — prose pruning — not from glyphs. Some substitutions are net-negative.

Consequences: judge every candidate substitution by `Δtokens`, never by character or line counts (both can shrink while tokens increase). R1–R4/R8–R10 buy consistency and unambiguous structure; R5/R6/R7 buy tokens. When Phase 4 flags `Δtokens ≈ 0` for a section, prefer the more readable form.

## Levels

The level enum is closed — L0–L3, one level per section (R13 below). **"derived" is NOT a level** — it is a mode (train E, #313).

- **L0 — verbatim class**: safety rules, commands, tool names, spawn templates (the G4 floor). Copied verbatim, never anchored — L0 loss is caught by the Phase 5 "safety rules intact" assertion, not by read-back. Recall is computed over non-L0 items only.
- **L1 — terse prose**: R5–R7 pruning + ASCII digraphs (`->`, `<=`) in place of glyphs — the home of the measured ~40% savings (§ What Actually Saves Tokens). Genre: human-facing docs — READMEs, guides, onboarding.
- **L2 — house symbolic (default)**: whitelist glyphs + the construct catalog — `I`/`V` contracts, pipeline verify-tables, `Σ`/`Σ_s` state maps, subscripted predicates `ψ_r`/`ψ_f`, parameterized ops `O_name(args)`, guard-functions, status glyphs `✓✗⏳⚠`.
- **L3 — externalize split**: core compressed under a ~500-token budget (measured via `python3 S count`, never estimated) + a residue doc linked `→ path — gloss`. Both files carry the marker (below).

Every non-L0 rule, condition, prohibition, threshold, edge case carries one `<!-- INV-<cat>-<n> -->` anchor (grammar: `references/verify.md`); L0 sections carry none.

**Auto-classification** — decision order, first match wins (content class beats doc genre beats size):

1. safety-rule / command / spawn-template content class → L0, always
2. human-facing doc genre → L1
3. skill/agent body → L2 (the default)
4. always-on file over budget → flagged for L3 split, subject to the present-choice gate below — never auto-applied

Escalation to L3 executes only after that present-choice confirmation. `--level <L>` (per file or per section) overrides the heuristic; the override is itself confirmed at Phase 4.

**R13 — single-level rule**: every section lands entirely at ONE level. Mixed-register request → refuse + present choice: **split the section** (each part at its own level) | **pick one level** for the whole section.

**Marker** — emitted immediately after frontmatter on every compressed output:

```
<!-- compress: level=<L> src-sha=<sha> glossary=<v> -->
```

`src-sha` = the Phase 2 pre-image hash of the source; `glossary` = the notation.md version marker, or `none` on a standalone install. L3 splits emit the marker on BOTH files with the same `src-sha`; the residue doc's marker appends `part=residue`. Marker `src-sha` ≠ the file's current hash → the source changed since compression → Phase 5a is forced before any re-compression.

**Per-file legend — mandatory for L2 outputs** (First Golden Run consequence, applied 2026-07-04 per `references/verify.md` § Go/No-Go): every L2 output carries a minimal per-file legend of the symbols it uses; legend tokens are subtracted from reported savings.

## Ledger Append (Phase 5)

One ledger row per completed target, appended ONLY via S (SKILL.md's sole ledger writer) — generate one run ULID (`python3 S new-ulid`) and share it as `--correlation` across every row of a multi-file run:

```
python3 S append --target "<f>" --mode <μ> --source-ref <hash> \
  --tokens-before <n> --tokens-after <n> --correlation <run-ulid> \
  --sections-json '[{"name": "…", "tokens_before": …, "tokens_after": …}]' --method <m> \
  --proxy-agreement <bool> --calibration "<line>"  # when captured in Phase 2
```
